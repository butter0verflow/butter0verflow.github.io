### Hello World!

My name is Abhijeet. I have a bachelor's of engineering in IT and I'm currently pursuing a masters in cybersecurity. I like football(soccer), pc games (fps shooters and TF2), hiking and all things security. I'm a newbie in infosec, trying to learn more about web app security at the moment. I also suck at writing, hence, trying to improve it with this blog.

Feel free to get in touch with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/butter0verflow) or discord (Abhi#9411). See you around!
